# Cape Cod Commission Financial Impact Model

> A Vue.js project that provides the user the ability to explore potential fiscal impacts to primary and secondary property owners on an annual basis with inflation and financing included.

## TODO

>  1. Update vue to v1.x + as it is breaking at it's current (master branch) state on Chrome and then breaks, but displays on Chrome if updating other packages that rely on vue 1.x +.
>  2. Adding/removing property taxes or betterments does not update cost/property owner values.
>  3. Within shared scenario cost, the total cost displayed might only be total capital costs, not total all cost types.
